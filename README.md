# Learning Rust through The Rust Book üìö

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Rust by following [*The Rust Programming Language*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html) (commonly known as *The Rust Book*). It contains code examples, exercises, and notes that I work on while progressing through the chapters of the book.

## About

Rust is a systems programming language focused on speed, memory safety, and parallelism. The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey as I explore the concepts, features, and examples provided by the official Rust book.

Each chapter of the book introduces new concepts, and I've created corresponding Rust projects and code snippets to practice what I've learned. This repository will act as a reference point for me and others who want to learn or review Rust programming concepts.

Each folder contains:
- Code examples from that chapter.
- Exercises and my solutions to the practice problems.
